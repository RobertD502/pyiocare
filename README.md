# pyiocare

This library is no longer being maintained and has been replaced by [Cowayaio](https://github.com/RobertD502/cowayaio). Note, as of November 2022, Coway is requiring all accounts to be transferred over to new Coway accounts (this can be done using the IoCare mobile app). **The transfer needs to be completed prior to using Cowayaio.**
